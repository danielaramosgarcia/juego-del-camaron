"Shrimp Game" made with Python,  displays a 6x6 board on the terminal and uses A,S,D,W keybord tiles to move user position represented by the leter 0. The goal position is represented by letter M in the board. 
Obstacles that can't be jumped are represented by symbol @ and obstacles that can be jumped are represented by symbol $. 
Everytime the program is excuted, the elements are in different locations. Once the goal is reached, the program will display how many moves the user made. 
This project is part of the final assingment of Computational Thinking from first semester of Computer Engineering
